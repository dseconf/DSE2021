**MATLAB ZURCHER CODE**
This code allows for solutions, estimation, simulation, and computation of equilibrium mileage and demand based on rust's engine replacement model Rust(Ecta, 1987). 

The MATLAB NFXP code is based on Rust original GAUSS code and documentation manual and has the following key features highlighted in the original NFXP manual

1. Solves fixed points on Bellman equations using a poly algorithm that optimally combines successive contraction iterations Newton iterations.
2. Recenter Bellman equation and logit formulas to avoid numerical overflow
3. Provides analytical gradients of Bellman operator
4. Provide analytical gradients of likelihood
5. Use BHHH (outer product of gradients as hessian approx.)

A variety of other methods proposed in the literature is also implemented (MPEC, NPL, BBL) for comparison and illustration.
